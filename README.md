# Password Cracking Lab: Comprehensive Analysis and Insights

This project presents an in-depth exploration of password cracking techniques, focusing on the role of LAN Manager settings and the application of **John the Ripper** for various password attacks. Through simulations and analysis, the lab evaluates the effectiveness of different password cracking strategies under various configurations, offering insights into improving password security.

## Objectives

1. **LAN Manager Policies**: Understand and modify LAN Manager authentication settings to enhance password security.
2. **John the Ripper Usage**: Utilize this powerful password cracking tool for:
   - Basic attacks.
   - Hybrid attacks (combining dictionary and brute-force methods).
   - Full brute-force password attacks.
3. **Evaluate Password Security**: Assess the success rate of cracking attempts and their implications for system security.

## Key Findings

### 1. **LAN Manager Settings**
   - **Initial Configuration**: LAN Manager authentication settings were configured to allow LM hashes, making systems vulnerable to legacy password cracking techniques.
   - **Enhanced Configuration**:
     - Disabled LAN Manager hashes.
     - Enforced **NTLMv2 responses only**, strengthening password security.
   - **Observations**: Systems configured with legacy LM responses proved significantly more vulnerable to password cracking compared to those using NTLMv2.

### 2. **John the Ripper Techniques**
   - John the Ripper was employed to simulate various attack types. Below are the configurations and outcomes:

#### **2.1 Dictionary Attack**
   - **Purpose**: Quickly identify weak passwords using a precompiled list of common passwords (dictionary file).
   - **Command Used**:
     ```bash
     john --wordlist=<dictionary-file> --stdin <hash-file>
     ```
   - **Outcome**: Cracked weak and commonly used passwords almost instantly, highlighting the importance of avoiding predictable passwords.

#### **2.2 Hybrid Attack**
   - **Purpose**: Combine dictionary attacks with brute-force techniques to generate permutations (e.g., adding numbers or symbols).
   - **Command Used**:
     ```bash
     john --wordlist=<dictionary-file> --rules <hash-file>
     ```
   - **Outcome**: Cracked moderately complex passwords that included predictable patterns, such as "password123" or "welcome@2023".

#### **2.3 Full Brute-Force Attack**
   - **Purpose**: Attempt all possible combinations of characters for maximum coverage.
   - **Command Used**:
     ```bash
     john --incremental <hash-file>
     ```
   - **Outcome**:
     - Successfully cracked shorter passwords within a reasonable time frame.
     - Significantly more time-intensive for longer passwords, demonstrating the importance of password length in resisting brute-force attacks.

---

### 3. **Password Attack Simulations**
   - **Weak Passwords**: Cracked almost immediately with dictionary and hybrid attacks.
   - **Moderate Passwords**: Cracked using hybrid attacks within a reasonable time frame.
   - **Strong Passwords**:
     - Resisted dictionary and hybrid attacks.
     - Required extensive computational resources for brute-force cracking, often making it infeasible.

## Key Insights and Recommendations

### **Password Security Best Practices**
1. **Disable Legacy Protocols**:
   - Avoid using LAN Manager hashes due to their vulnerability.
   - Enforce NTLMv2-only authentication for better security.
   
2. **Adopt Strong Password Policies**:
   - Require passwords with a minimum length of 12â€“16 characters.
   - Enforce complexity by including upper- and lowercase letters, numbers, and special symbols.

3. **Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**:
   - Adds an additional layer of security, making it significantly harder for attackers to compromise accounts even if passwords are cracked.

4. **Regular Audits**:
   - Use tools like John the Ripper to periodically test for weak passwords in controlled environments.
   - Ensure all accounts comply with organizational password standards.

5. **User Awareness and Training**:
   - Educate users on the risks of reusing passwords or choosing weak, predictable patterns.
   - Encourage the use of password managers for generating and storing complex passwords.
